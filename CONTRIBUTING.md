# Contributing to Communication Gategay project

First of all, thank you for considering contributing to Arch Linux México. It's people like you that make Arch Linux México such a great community.

Welcome! Read the following sections to find out how to get involved in the development of this project.

### Why should I read this guide?
Following these guides helps communicate that you respect the time of the developers who are managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocally address your issue, review the changes, and help you finalize your pull requests.

### What kind of contributions are we looking for?
**Arch Linux México** is a FOSS community and we love receiving contributions from our community, from you!

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving documentation, generating bug reports and enhancement requests, participating in chat rooms, or writing code that can be incorporated into this website as such.

**Please**, Do not use the issues panel for [support questions].

Instead, join the IRC channel [#archlinux-mx](ircs://chat.freenode.net/archlinux-mx) on Freenode or in the [group chat on Telegram](https://t.me/archlinux) and there we will help you with your issue.


# Main rules
Responsibilities
* Make sure the compatibility between versions of your Pull Request and this Repository
* Create issues for any major changes and improvements you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get feedback from the community.
* Keep versioning of new features as short as possible.
* Be nice to newcomers and support a diversity of new and new contributors from all backgrounds.


# Your first contribution
Still don't know how to start contributing to Arch Linux México?

You can start by checking the issues with tags help-wanted-needed and feature/enhancement (enhancement):

* Help wanted: These are issues that can be a bit more complicated than beginner issues.
Both lists of issues are ordered by the amount of comments they have. Although not perfect, the amount of comments is a reasonable proxy for the impact the change will have.

* Feature/enhancement: This type of issue helps us organize future work or any improvement that needs to be made.

### Resources for those who have never previously contributed to an Open Source project.

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how in this *free* series, [How to contribute to an Open Source project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you are ready or ready to make changes! Feel free to ask for help; we were all beginners once :smile_cat:

If a maintainer asks you to do a "rebase" to the PR, they mean that a lot of code has changed and that you should update the branch to make it easier to link it to the rest of the code.

# Starting

1. Create your own fork of the repository
2. Make the changes to your fork
3. If you like change and you think the project could use it:
    * Send a pull request

Small contributions such as spelling errors, where the content is small enough not to be considered intellectual property, can be added as a contributor patch.

As a rule of thumb, changes can be considered "obvious fixes" if they don't introduce new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some examples include the following:
* Spelling/Grammar Corrections
* Correction of an error in the writing of a word, blank spaces and format changes
* Comment cleaning
* Correction of Bugs that change the values ​​that are returned or error codes saved in constants
* Add log messages or debug outputs
* Changes to 'metadata' files such as Gemfile, `.gitignore`, build scripts, etc.
* Move files with code from one directory or package to another

# How to report a bug
When you fill out an issue, be sure to answer these questions:

1. What did you do?
2. What did you expect to see?
3. What did you see instead?

General questions should go in the chat groups (Telegram and IRC) instead of the issue tracker. Join to the community!

# How to suggest a new feature
If you find yourself disdaining a feature that doesn't exist on the site, you're probably not alone. Open an issue in the GitHub issues list that describes the feature you'd like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code Review Process
Who reviews it? Who needs to sign before it is accepted? When should the contributor expect you to respond? How can a contributor have access to commit, if necessary?

The core team reviews the Pull Requests, after the feedback is given, responses are expected in the next two weeks. After that the pull request may be closed due to inactivity.


# Community
You can join the community at [Telegram](https://t.me/archlinuxmx) and the IRC chat room on Freenode: [#archlinux-mx](ircs://chat.freenode.net/archlinux-mx)


# Commit and tag messages
We would like you to be descriptive in the commit message using the prefix `feature` and `fix`. An example could be:

```
feature: Add Arch Linux theme as git submodule
```
